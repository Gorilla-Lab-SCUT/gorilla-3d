class PointNetFeatExt(nn.Module):
    r"""PointNet feature extractor (extracts either global or local, i.e.,
    per-point features).
    Based on the original PointNet paper:.
    .. note::
        If you use this code, please cite the original paper in addition to Kaolin.

            @article{qi2016pointnet,
              title={PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation},
              author={Qi, Charles R and Su, Hao and Mo, Kaichun and Guibas, Leonidas J},
              journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.00593},
              year={2016}
            }
    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input pointcloud
            (default: 3, for X, Y, Z coordinates respectively).
        feat_size (int): Size of the global feature vector
            (default: 1024)
        layer_dims (Iterable[int]): Sizes of fully connected layers
            to be used in the feature extractor (excluding the input and
            the output layer sizes). Note: the number of
            layers in the feature extractor is implicitly parsed from
            this variable.
        global_feat (bool): Extract global features (i.e., one feature
            for the entire pointcloud) if set to True. If set to False,
            extract per-point (local) features (default: True).
        activation (function): Nonlinearity to be used as activation
                    function after each batchnorm (default: F.relu)
        batchnorm (bool): Whether or not to use batchnorm layers
            (default: True)
        transposed_input (bool): Whether the input's second and third dimension
            is already transposed. If so, a transpose operation can be avoided,
            improving performance.
            See documentation for the forward method for more details.
    For example, to specify a PointNet feature extractor with 4 linear
    layers (sizes 6 -> 10, 10 -> 40, 40 -> 500, 500 -> 1024), with
    3 input channels in the pointcloud and a global feature vector of size
    1024, see the example below.
    Example:
        >>> pointnet = PointNetFeatExt(in_channels=3, feat_size=1024,
                                           layer_dims=[10, 20, 40, 500])
        >>> x = torch.rand(2, 3, 30)
        >>> y = pointnet(x)
        print(y.shape)
